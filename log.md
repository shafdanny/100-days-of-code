# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 4, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Started building portfolio website using Bootstrap

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with web development. This explains why I did not finish my website until now. I've been looking at various frameworks and finally decided to stick with Bootstrap. It offers a lot of components with minimum hassle to set up. However, CSS is still a PITA when trying to organize the different elements.
